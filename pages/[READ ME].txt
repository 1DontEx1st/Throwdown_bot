	Do this after you update or delete your bot.	
	Step-1		open an existing sheet or create a new sheet	
	Step-2		Menu > Tools > Script Editor..	
	Step-3		Menu > Edit > All your triggers (Might ask you to create a new project, just press ok)	
	Step-4		Delete all triggers with "Load" and "_RumbleTrigger"	
			
		This is due to an issue with google sheets thats been around for years... 	
		The issue is sometimes google won't delete all the triggers after the sheets been deleted.	
			
			
		The script is slow to run due to limitations in javascript & Kongregate.	
		The script shows as (unsafe) due to a policy by google regarding remote links.	
		The script will run a check every 30 minutes.	
		No information is tracked or saved on our end. Ever. Period
